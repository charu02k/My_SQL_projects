1.) Myntra Brand Report Card
##Project overview
Myntra Brand Report Card is a small SQL project that demonstrates how to retrieve, aggregate, and present brand-level performance metrics from a Myntra-like e‑commerce dataset.
The repository contains SQL scripts and examples to build a "brand report card" — a single-page summary for any brand that shows sales, pricing, discounts, ratings, inventory and product-mix insights.
